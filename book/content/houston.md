But **we can use Conda** Right? Right?
```

## Conda

An article has hasÂ [recently been going around](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/08/anaconda_puts_the_squeeze_on/)  about Anaconda â€” the creators of Conda â€” deciding that not-for-profit organizations (such as universities) must now pay to use their tools. Unfortunately there is **no community consensus**Â about the right tool to use to manage Python versions and environments. Instead, we are stuck with at least five different popular tools, one of which is Conda.

## The alternatives

 Python distribution and environment management is currently in a problematic state, which likely explains why a for-profit company still holds relevance in the open-source Python ecosystem in 2024. In the broader Python software development community, there are numerous tools available to manage your Python installation, such as:

- [Pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)
- [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
- [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)
- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)
- [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch)
- [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm)
- [Rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye)

Each has varying levels of features. A persistent issue in Python is the lack of a standard for defining a development environment, which means many environments are incompatible with each other.

The Conda ecosystem confines you to using Conda. Installing packages with `pip` while using Conda risks breaking the Conda environment, preventing access to most packages on the official Python repository, PyPI. Very common when you are usine the `bioconda` channel.

Additionally, Conda is a very bloated tool that requires many gigabytes of storage space per environment, making it impractical for machines with limited disk space (such as a small user account on an HPC cluster). The 'solution' in the Conda world is to use _yet another alternative tool_ (ðŸ˜­) like mamba, micromamba, miniforgeâ€¦ the list goes on.

**Homebrew's Python**

While Homebrew is a powerful package manager for macOS, its approach to Python version management can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

**Key Issues with Homebrew's Python:**

1. **Automatic Upgrades:** Homebrew automatically upgrades Python versions and their dependencies. This can disrupt your development environment if you rely on specific Python versions for different projects.
2. **Deletion of Old Versions:** After 30 days, Homebrew automatically removes older Python versions, potentially causing issues if you need to revert to a previous version.

## venv: the easiest solution

Is already included as a module:

```bash
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install PACKAGE

deactivate
```

## pyenv: a simple solution

**[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)Â is a simple tool for installing multiple Python versions.**Â pyenv is lightweight, and just uses a clever shell script and shim approach to manage Python for you.
You also donâ€™t need to have Python installed already to install pyenv with.

Then, once you set up pyenv, you can install packages in the environment of your choice with pip.

*The instructions below work for Linux or Mac; Windows users should follow instructions in theÂ [Windows-compatible fork](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)Â instead.*

**Installation:**

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

**Adding pyenv to your shell configuration:** Follow the instructions provided after installation to add pyenv to your shell configuration (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

**Using pyenv:**

- **List Available Python Versions:**

```bash
pyenv install --list
```

- **Install a Specific Python Version:**

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.3
```

- **Set the Global Python Version:**

```bash
pyenv global 3.11.3
```

- **Set a Local Python Version for a Specific Directory:**

```bash
cd my_project
pyenv local 3.9.13
```

- **List Installed Python Versions:**

```bash
pyenv versions
```

## uv: the all-in-one solution

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)Â is a next-generation Python package installer and manager that is 10-100x faster than pip, and also makes it easy to install Python and manage projects. WithÂ `uv`, creating a virtual environment is as easy asÂ `uvÂ venv`.

**Installation**

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.

powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

You can install `uv` using PowerShell, but for a more integrated and efficient development environment, consider using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl). WSL enables you to run a full Linux distribution alongside your Windows system, allowing you to access a wide range of Linux tools and libraries, including `uv`. This eliminates the need for complex virtual machine setups or dual-booting.

## Setting a work environment

**Create a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

**Activate the Environment:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Pin the Python Version (optional):**

If you are creating multiple environments in your current directory, so the next time you don't need to specify the python version`

```bash
uv python pin 3.12
```

**Initialize an `uv` project**

`uv init` creates a new Python project with a pyproject.toml file and, a lockfile.

```bash
uv init
```

**Install Packages:**

Generally, using `uv add` is recommended as it provides better project management and reproducibility. It automatically manages package versions and ensures consistent installations across different environments.

However, if you need to quickly install a package without modifying your `pyproject.toml` file, you can use `uv pip install`.

```bash
uv add jupyterlab jupyter-book jupyterlab-tour \
       ipython pandas numpy seaborn
```

### Pre-commit hooks

A pre-commit hook is a script that runs automatically before a commit is made.

```bash
pip install pre-commit

# uv add pre-commit

```bash
Then create a file namedÂ `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- you can generate a very basic configuration usingÂ [`pre-commit sample-config`](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-sample-config)
- the full set of options for the configuration are listedÂ [here](https://pre-commit.com/#plugins)

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: jupyter-nb-clear-output
        name: jupyter-nb-clear-output
        files: \.ipynb$
        stages: [commit]
        language: python
        entry: jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace
        additional_dependencies: [jupyter]
```

Install the git hook scripts:

- runÂ `pre-commit install`Â to set up the git hook scripts

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Code formatting for notebooks

```bash
pip install -U "nbqa[toolchain]"
# uv add "nbqa[toolchain]"

nbqa black my_notebook.ipynb

nbqa isort my_notebook.ipynb
```

## Jupyter Book

Jupyter Book is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and interactive books and documents from Jupyter Notebooks. It's perfect for sharing your data science projects, tutorials, documentation.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive Content:** Embed interactive visualizations and code cells directly into your book.
- **Easy Deployment:** Deploy your book to the web with a single command.

**Basic Usage:**

1. **Create a Jupyter Book Project:** Initialize a new Jupyter Book project in your desired directory:

```bash
jupyter-book init my_book
```

2. **Write Your Content:** Create Jupyter Notebooks with your content, including text, code, and visualizations.

3. **Build Your Book:** Build your book into static HTML files:

```bash
jupyter-book build my_book
```

4. **Clean the Build:** Remove any temporary files generated during the build process:

```bash
jupyter-book clean my_book --all
```

5. **Serve Locally:** Serve your book locally to view it in a web browser:

```bash
jupyter-book serve my_book
```

## Where can I deploy my book?

For me, the best options is a **Static Hosting Platform:** like:

- **(Netlify)[https://www.netlify.com]:** Known for its ease of use and integration with GitHub.
- **(GitHub Pages)[https://pages.github.com]:** Free hosting for GitHub repositories, suitable for simple projects.
